- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Toh Yong Yao (@porporkins) and I graduated from National University of Singapore in 2015 with a degree in Computer Science. Currently working as a cyber security software engineer.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building innovative solutions that are scalable, reliable, and secure against cyber security attacks to solve real-world issues. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node.js as a back-end framework to pick up the skill sets of a full stack software engineer and working towards building my own project as well as contributing to open source projects too.
